I feel ignored. I feel like my community is ignored. I have had to call every two weeks since the Spring to get graffiti removed from the City sidewalk that my building is on (#***). Every time I call, it takes my personal unpaid time. Every time, the City claims they removed it, so I send a picture, or I say it's still there. I live in Regent Park and it feels like the City doesn't take care of us. When you walk in Riverdale, you see the beautifully kept dog parks and gardens - my dog park has exposed piping jutting out. The City legitimately let the Regent Park field burn to a fully yellow crisp this month instead of watering it. I write my councillor, but I never get an answer. When I ask 311 for help escalating, they say all I can do is keep calling. There's no one to reach and it makes me feel frustrated. This is my home! I bought here on the understanding that we were revitalizing this neighbourhood together, but it seems like the City has institutional bias towards Regent Park.  One week, giant freight trucks were going down my tiny street of Sackville. It was so loud, and bad for the infrastructure. Maybe 60 trucks a day taking my small residential street instead of Parliament, which is just parallel. I looked up the street rules, and I saw that the portion of my street that falls in the affluent Cabbagetown, trucks were prohibited, but the portion in Regent Park, they were allowed! I tried to write my councillor and call, and they said they would follow up but never did.  I feel as though there's institutional bias to my neighbourhood and that's shameful and there is no one to tell except the newspapers.

Staff emphasizing that all voices are welcome. I have appreciated the new formats being tried by City Planning (eg. YouTube explainers, Reddit AMA, Twitter Spaces, neighbourhood walks), especially those where discussion can happen asynchronously for people with busy schedules. Appreciate the attempts to hold meetings at a variety of times, although I think it is impossible to make this work for everyone, which is why other methods are better. Surveys are usually well-constructed to get specific info and I think they are a less intimidating entry point, which is one reason that these can get higher engagement numbers.","Don't like that councillors give speeches at the start that shape discussion  this can undermine staff's 'all are welcome' message. I have heard these speeches used to say that they only want to hear from residents of X Street, or to imply that some people matter more than others. Councillors also jump in for long back and forths with people they know/like and give them time to monopolize discussion, dismiss those they don't by saying they don't live in the right place. I feel that in-person (and virtual while it replaced in-person) comments are weighted more heavily, which favours those with more flexible schedules. Engagement sometimes seemed to be used as a way to delay projects or for those with more free time to outlast those with busier lives. Eg. Recent EHON multiplex item, it was moved that there should be additional consultation in one specific ward, specifically with residents' associations. These groups were already consulted in the extensive multi-year process and were part of the EHON roundtable. Why do they deserve to be prioritized over other residents for additional say? Why do they get the last word over all of the other people who answered surveys or emailed in?

Although sometimes things take time, complaints and requests are generally addressed.","This is a huge question which is difficult to answer in a blanket statement. I think the 311 service is generally excellent. However, I do wonder how effectively the city engages residents in such larger issues as climate change. Most residents remain unaware of the problem and the measures they can take to become part of the solution. Traffic is another area I'm increasingly frustrated by. Driving has become horrific, I'm afraid to bicycle, and even walking has become a challenge as different modes of transportation compete for limited space on narrow roads and sidewalks. Rules of the road are either not known, ignored or not enforced. There seems to be no coordination between different agencies involved in tearing up roads, and the amount of road construction and the duration of road disruptions has become absurd. The number of people with mental health or addiction issues seems to be growing exponentially, and it would be very helpful to know if anyone is helping them and what to do when you see them lying in doorways or raving down the street.",65+,Home owner,,Postal Code:,M6G,No,,,,,,,,,1,,,,Woman,,Heterosexual or straight,,Prefer not to answer

I only find out about most because I am city staff and I subscribe to all news updates. e.g. there was a survey about feedback on under-5 covid vaccine planning done by Toronto Public Health. I only found it in a Facebook group for vaccine advocacy for parents (very engaged and aware participants). it wasn't shared through official channels (not even posted by TPH's twitter account) that I get, or through my child's daycare or doctor's office, through my MPP or City Councilor newsletter or even through the mail or ads. These types of surveys are only reaching those who are eager and already engaged. are PR/news City Staff allowed to join FB groups and post there in an official capacity? Something like that would help for local neighbourhood groups. The twitter accounts need to be more active, not just posting but replying and providing these links in conversations or in response to popular account's pages. Or have more postering campaigns by staff if official ads or mailers aren't in the budget. A park was being re-designed in my neighbourhood and had a sign up there that I only saw randomly driving by one day (I stayed away because it was an out-of date park so wouldn't have normally seen it). maybe staff could drop off fliers about these things to surrounding areas. Whatever the ideas are, publicity needs to be improved A LOT.

Some people don't like online consultations for this reason, but I believe that's because they're not used to being outnumbered democratically. Formal in person meetings are easier for small groups of people to appear like they are the majority, when they are not.

It's a challenge to engage these people but it matters a lot. In some parts of Toronto, the same vocal minority get a lot of time and attention and they often don't represent most of the people in their community. Quick example: some Summerhill residents talk about being 'land-locked' and complain about bike lanes and other changes to infrastructure. The people who voice these complaints tend to be privileged in that they have time to organize and create websites, campaign, write letters to the city, etc. Meanwhile, many people in Summerhill want more transportation options but they are too busy and/or don't know how to engage.

E.g. Ask us on topic A and then we can provide input before the survey on topic A. It would be better to provide a 'somewhat agree' option versus 'neither agree nor disagree'. Also, people should be allowed to select more than three factors that would enable them to engage more. There needs to be more transparency around what can I actually have influence over such as will my input actually make a difference. Also, better communication with updates happening as things unfold to provide a greater sense of involvement as things develop vs. a meeting (or meetings happen) and then months later or a year or more later, something is launched. I think there are a lot of skills that people have that could be better utilized if the city makes the changes I've suggested (including the 'other' option I added in this survey).",Prefer not to answer,Prefer not to answer,,Prefer not to answer,,Prefer not to answer,,,,,,,,,,1,,Prefer not to answer,Prefer not to answer,,Prefer not to answer,,Prefer not to answer

I only learned of this survey because I read a newsletter I signed up for by Googling poverty reduction in Toronto. The newsletter was supposedly monthly - this is the fourth one I have received in three years. The City MUST find better ways of communicating with the public and engaging people in its processes. How on earth is a process going to be participatory if only people in-the-know can access it? Get out into the community, find people at their work, their home, their community centres - hair salons, grocery stores, coffee shops - and tell them what you're doing, and ask for their participation. And offer accommodation - childcare, TTC fare, a small honorarium - to honor their time. YOU are being paid for this work, but THEIR input is critical.",30-64,Home owner,,Postal Code:,M4N,No,,,,,,,,,1,,,No,Woman,,Heterosexual or straight,,"$150,000 or more"

It is understandable there are big picture city issues to address, however, they shouldn't be done without consideration of the impact to the local communities affected. Often surveys, consultations, meetings are structured or led in such a way as to achieve the City's intended goal rather to actually hear what residents have to say. And when residents share their view, they are often given responses to placate them, or generally ignored in favor of an agenda. As one example, the city's vision that in 20-30 yrs, 75% of commuting under 5km will be done by foot or bike, which is contributing to putting bike lanes across the city, including on major streets. That is just not reasonable (consider families, winter, amount of parcels carried, health/aging population, etc).

The City has policy and guidelines and professionals to review projects. 2. Ensure the voices of those not in the room are identified.
